> What is an Abstract syntax tree (AST)?
> Abstract syntax trees are [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) widely used in [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), due to their property of representing the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of the [syntax analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) phase of a compiler.
